# Testing-Practice-

A small JavaScript project for practicing unit testing with **Jest** and **Babel**, using ES6 module syntax (`import` / `export`).  

This project includes:
- `capitalize` — Capitalizes the first letter of a string.
- `reverseString` — Reverses a string.
- `calculator` — Basic math operations (add, subtract, divide, multiply).
- `caesarCipher` — Implements a Caesar cipher with case preservation and punctuation handling.
- `analyzeArray` — Returns average, min, max, and length for an array of numbers.
